> **Board presentations should tell a story. Numbers matter—but narrative matters more.** — Dan O'Leary

:::tip[Insider Tip]
Board meetings are not status reports. They're strategic reviews. Your deck should answer: "Are we winning? What's changing? What do we need?"
:::

## How to Use This Template

**Purpose:**
This deck communicates partner program performance and strategy to the board of directors. It positions the partner program as a strategic growth driver.

**Why It Works:**
A well-structured board deck demonstrates executive presence, strategic thinking, and data-driven decision making. It builds confidence in the partner program and secures ongoing investment.

**Steps:**

1. **Gather data** — Pull metrics and prepare analytics (1-2 hours)
2. **Build narrative** — Structure the story (2-3 hours)
3. **Rehearse** — Practice delivery with Q&A (1 hour)
4. **Present** — Deliver to board (15-20 min + Q&A)

## Common Board Questions

Prepare answers to these likely questions:

| "What's the ROI on partners?" | Compare CAC with vs. without partners |
| "Who are our top partners?" | Name names, show revenue concentration |
| "What's the churn rate?" | Be honest, explain root cause |
| "Why should we invest more?" | Quantify the opportunity |
