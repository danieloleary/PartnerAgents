Use this template to build a compelling financial case for your partner program—or to validate an existing one.

:::tip[Insider Tip]
The #1 reason partner programs get cancelled? No clear ROI. CFOs approve budgets that show measurable return, not "strategic alignment." This calculator gives you the numbers.

## How to Use This Template

This template provides the formulas, frameworks, and examples you need to calculate partner program ROI. It's designed for finance teams, partner managers, and executives who need to justify investment.

### Why It Works

When you can show a CFO exact payback period and ROI multiples, you remove the biggest blocker to program approval. This isn't guesswork—it's financial rigor.

### Choose Your Level

| Level | Time | Best For |
|-------|------|----------|
| **Quick Win** | 30 min | Ballpark estimate for leadership |
| **Standard** | 1-2 hr | Detailed model with scenarios |
| **Executive** | 2-3 hr | Board-ready presentation |

## The Partner ROI Framework

Before calculating, understand the key components that drive partner program ROI:

### Revenue Inputs

- **Partner-sourced revenue**: Revenue from deals partners bring directly
- **Partner-influenced revenue**: Revenue from deals with partner involvement
- **Partner-sourced pipeline**: Registered deals in sales funnel
- **Partner quote volume**: Quotes/proposals with partner pricing

### Cost Inputs

- **Program operational costs**: Partner management, training, enablement
- **Partner enablement costs**: Training, certifications, marketing funds
- **Technology costs**: Partner portal, CRM, PRM system
- **Partner incentive costs**: Rebates, commissions, SPIFFs

### The Core Formula

```
ROI = (Net Partner Revenue - Total Partner Costs) / Total Partner Costs × 100

Payback Period = Total Partner Costs / Monthly Partner Revenue
```

## Key Metrics to Track

Once approved, track these monthly to validate your model:

| Metric | Target | How to Measure |
|--------|--------|----------------|
| Partner Revenue per Active Partner | \$20,000+ | Total partner revenue / # active |
| Cost to Serve per Partner | &lt;\$8,000 | Total program cost / # partners |
| Partner-Influenced Pipeline | 3x registered | CRM attribution |
| Time to First Partner Revenue | &lt;90 days | First deal date - partner sign date |

## What I Wish I Knew

The biggest mistake? Overestimating revenue and underestimating costs. Be conservative—it's easier to exceed expectations than defend missed targets.

The second mistake? Not calculating payback period. CFOs don't just want ROI—they want to know when they'll get their money back. Aim for 18 months or less.

The third mistake? Ignoring partner churn. Assume 20% annual churn and build that into your model. Conservative assumptions build trust.
